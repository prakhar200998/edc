## High-level Idea of EDC

EDC uses a three-phase framework to approach the task of knowledge graph construction from input text. It first applies open information extraction to extract open knowledge graphs and then performs post-hoc canonicalization using the definition of the schema induced by the open KG generated by LLMs. This approach is able to scale to large realistic schemas compared to previous approaches while still requiring no parameter tuning.

Here is an illustration of how EDC works:
