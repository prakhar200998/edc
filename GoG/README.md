# Knowledge Graph Interaction with GPT and Neo4j

## Overview
This project integrates OpenAI's GPT with a Neo4j knowledge graph to process user queries dynamically by extracting relevant information, interacting with a language model, and potentially updating the graph based on the insights generated.

## Setup
1. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Ensure Neo4j is running and accessible.
3. Set up your OpenAI API key in your environment variables.

## Running the Application
Execute the script via:
```bash
python src/main.py
